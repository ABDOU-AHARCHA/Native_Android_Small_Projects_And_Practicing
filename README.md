# 📚 Native Android Mini Projects & Practice

This repository contains small Android projects and exercises that I developed in the past as part of my learning journey in Native Android Development.

⚠️ These mini projects were created strictly for learning and practice purposes.  
They were not intended for production use or public release, but rather to strengthen my understanding of Android fundamentals and core development concepts.
