# Kotlin Small Projects
This repository contains a collection of small projects written in Kotlin. These projects were created as part of my learning journey with the Kotlin programming language, and are designed to showcase my skills and experience with the language.

## Projects
### Weather App:
A simple Android app that displays the current weather for a given location. Built using the OpenWeatherMap API and the Kotlin programming language.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game: 
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Kotlin. This game allows two players to play against each other and keeps track of the game state and winner.

### PokeMap Game: 
An Android app that uses the Google Maps API to display a map of the player's location and nearby Pokemon. Players can move around the map to catch Pokemon and earn points.
